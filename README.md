## Database Design and Development

Our new start up restaurant is scaling fast, leaving our old methods in the dust. There is no system to display orders, food items the order contains or payment method electronically. To keep up with our fast-paced business, we have decided to formulate a database where all transactions can be tracked and organized efficiently. We seek to store information about orders, chefs, our customers, food items we provide, and payment methods. The database will also be able to quickly query and answer questions such as: 
  
    - What are the available dishes?
    
    - What is the price of spaghetti?
    
    - What payment methods are offered?  
    
    - What is the chefâ€™s name? 
    
    - What payment method is order #1099 use?
